    <h1>howdy, folks</h1>
    <p>Written: May 3rd, 2020</p>

    <p>Long story short? I guess I got a jump on this whole quarantine business. I’ve been taking some time to myself trying to figure out some things. Spoiler: I haven’t figured out much at all, but I think maybe that’s okay.</p>
    <p>I’ve been dealing with mental illness for most of my life. On paper, I suffer from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. To wildly overgeneralize things, my day-to-day life can range from “I don’t want to do anything and I wish I didn’t exist” to “I want to do everything and I’m going to live forever” and everything in between. I’ve taken many different medications to deal with this, and recently I’ve found a combination that seems to be helping me find a good place in the middle.</p>
    <p>That being said, I’ve still felt like I’ve been slipping away from myself for a while. So in January I decided to stop drinking, and soon after that I decided to stop going out altogether. I quit my job; I logged out of my social media accounts, which for months already I had been using less and less; I took more than a few big steps away from everything so I could have some space to just exist for a little while. Then, I started reading more; I revisited some old songs and poems I had written over the last decade, and started writing some new ones; I started meditating again; I drank a lot of coffee; I watched a <i>lot</i> of Netflix.</p>
    <p>Eventually I asked myself some heavy questions, and tried to answer as honestly as I possibly could.</p>
    <p>What I found is that I couldn’t keep up with myself. I had been changing, like everyone does throughout their life, but I had been changing quickly and I had stopped paying attention and suddenly I couldn’t keep up. I couldn’t recognize myself, and I couldn’t remember who I’d been before. I’d gone from A to B but in between was just a bunch of noise, and I couldn’t recognize any of it anymore.</p>
    <p>I wish I could follow that by saying “I thought about it some more and now I know who I am and who I’ve been and everything is fine,” but that’s not true. I still don’t have a clue about any of this, frankly. But I think maybe it’s okay to not know, to <i>never</i> know, and instead to just… be.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, here are a few things I now feel pretty certain about:</p>
    <p>1. A lot of things make me nervous. Things like clowns and going to the dentist, but also things like social media and confrontation. It’s a long list and I’m finding new things all the time and that, too, makes me nervous.</p>
    <p>2. A lot of things also make me happy and that’s a very good thing to remember.</p>
    <p>3. Being kind is the most important thing anyone can ever do. To other people; to animals; to the planet; to themselves; to everything, everywhere, all of the time.</p>
    <p>And so… now what? To put it bluntly, I’ve really enjoyed being in this space away from everything, so that’s where I’ll be staying for a while. To anyone who has reached out, you’re a saint and I appreciate you, even if I don’t see it or don’t respond. The thought counts, always.</p>
    <p>Stay safe, stay home, stay gold. &#x2764;</p>

    <p>I’m tired. I’m just so goddamn tired, always.</p>
    <p>Living with mental illness is exhausting. Nothing but nonsense upstairs, just noise and noise and noise, ad infinitum. Ad nauseum. Ad mortem. Ad undas.</p>
    <p>I’m beat, man. Is this what Kerouac meant? Beat down, beat up, beat to the punch. I’m empty but I’ve got a good beat; you can dance to me.</p>
    <p>At the best of times, I’m an artist. I’m a spectacle; I’m a parade. I’m a thief. I’m paraphrasing.</p>
    <p>The rough draft always feels more honest than the rest. Burn the filter and let the truth fall free and see that it is good and real and urgent.</p>
    <p>I’m just so very tired. Please bear with me.</p>

    <p>The thing is, we still don’t have any of this figured out. Not really. Poverty, hunger, water scarcity, homelessness, genocide, war, corruption, deforestation, pollution, greed, hatred, exclusion, malice, so many tremendously evil things take place in a world that is so capable of being good.</p>
    <p>This world is fundamentally capable of being good. In the midst of and in spite of so much evil, we are all so very fundamentally capable of being good.</p>
    <p>I had forgotten this. I was asleep at the wheel; things in my life had been changing for a long time and I stopped paying attention and then one day the world that could be so good suddenly looked empty to me, as if all the good had been drained out of it, and all that was left was just noise and static and me, floating somewhere in the middle of it all. I was asleep at the wheel and I was lost in the world and I had forgotten this one simple truth:</p>
    <p>We are still so very fundamentally capable of being good.</p>
    <p>Even when all the good is gone and we’re all asleep at the wheel and the world looks empty and evil and broken — at the very end of it all, even then we are capable of being good.</p>
    <p>So I looked at the world of noise and static and I took a few steps back and I closed my eyes.</p>
    <p>I let the truth come find me.</p>
